# React Flow Graphix

React Flow Graphix is a **dynamic graph visualization tool** built using **React**, **Redux**, and **React Flow**. It provides an interactive and customizable interface for creating and managing node-based graphs. The application leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **React Icons** for UI enhancements.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Create, connect, and modify nodes with ease.
- **Custom Nodes**: Supports fully customizable node designs.
- **State Management**: Uses **Redux** to manage the application state efficiently.
- **Undo & Redo**: Implement undo and redo functionality for better control.
- **Fit View on Load**: Automatically adjusts the graph to fit the view on load.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, adaptive layout.

## Key Technologies

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React is used in this project to create a flexible component-based architecture for managing and visualizing graphs efficiently.

- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library that simplifies handling application state. In this project, Redux Toolkit is used to manage graph data, enabling efficient updates and synchronization across components.

- **React Flow**: A graph visualization library for React that allows for intuitive creation, connection, and management of nodes. It is used to implement drag-and-drop nodes, interactive edges, and advanced layout customization.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a responsive and modern design. Tailwind is used in this project to style the application efficiently, ensuring a clean and adaptive layout.

- **React Icons**: A collection of customizable icons that enhance the user interface. React Icons are used throughout the project to provide intuitive visual elements and improve user experience.

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling framework that provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build times. It enhances the development experience by making the app faster and more efficient.
